<h1>Polls2k11 - Get the latest polls for the Portuguese legislative election, 2011</h1>

<h2>What's this?</h2>

<p>Polls2k11 provides the latest poll information for the Portuguese
legislative election 2011 in a machine readable format, currently JSON
with JSONP support.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_legislative_election,_2011">Wikipedia</a>
provides a pretty nice page showing opinion polls data relating to the
2011 Portuguese legislative elections. I had some ideas to use that
information but I need that information structured in a decent format.</p>

<p>I built a script to get the data from Wikipedia and convert that
information to JSON. I made this public so everyone can use and create
nice apps.</p>

<h2>Available clients</h2>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/bmareal">Bruno Areal</a> built a JS client for this
API. A running version of this client is available at
<a href="http://polls.simaomata.com/charts">http://polls.simaomata.com/charts</a></p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<h3>Host it yourself</h3>

<p>You can install this script and host it yourself.</p>

<p>If you don't require JSONP, all you need to do is run polls.py every
time you need to update the data.</p>

<p>If you need JSONP, you can deploy a pollserver.py and use the
endpoints defined there.</p>

<p>Use can also use my installation to get the data, see below.</p>

<h3>Use http://polls.simaomata.com</h3>

<p>You can also use my installation at
<a href="http://polls.simaomata.com">polls.simaomata.com</a></p>

<p>The following endpoints are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://polls.simaomata.com/all">http://polls.simaomata.com/all</a> -
Returns latest known information about all 2011 polls</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://polls.simaomata.com/latest">http://polls.simaomata.com/latest</a> - Returns information about the most recent poll</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All information provided by these endpoints is updated once a day.</p>

<p>All information can be obtained from a browser using JSONP. If you
pass a GET parameter named "jsonp=callbackName", the response will be
the following:</p>

<pre><code>callbackName(pollData);
</code></pre>

<p>Check the example below for more information on this.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h3>Using jQuery to get JSONP data</h3>

<p>An example is provided in jsonp_example.html. This examples fetches
data from /all using JSONP and jQuery and displays the result in a
simple manner.</p>

response:</p>
